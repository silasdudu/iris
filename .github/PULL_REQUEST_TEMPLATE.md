> **it's not personal to somebody specific**, I don't want to attack to anyone, I am polite but I had to write these complaints, eventually.

I wanted to answer on some users who complaining that I'm not accepting PRs to the main code base.

I am accepting PRs to the [iris-contrib](https://github.com/iris-contrib) and I see how things were gone.
As you already know I'm not a native english speaker, the gitbook PRs were **all excellent and I thanks you from my deep of my heart!**. My complain and my personal experience with PRs
you will read below is a fact for all repositories **except the gitbook's PRs and zaplogger middleware**.


There weren't many PRs but anyway...some people 'attacking' me because I code all alone, this is what it is.

Let's take for example the `cors` middleware.
Yes that middleware which didn't worked for you and the 80% of the overral middleware's issues were for this and only this middleware.


The guy who did the first PR to the cors middleware didn't answer to your issues, I had to do it that,
I had to answer for another's code.

It's true that I don't like these situations and this is the reason why I'm always avoid of accepting PRs to the main iris codebase.
Do you imagine what would happen if I was accepting PRs here, to the main iris repository?... I don't.
Not because the community sucks and they are not good as me, maybe they are better but they are not **responsible** for their code
and I'm sorry for telling you that but this is what I received as an experience of letting people to 'help' at the beggining:
better safe and 'alone' rather than a transformation of the framework to a collection of big 'anarchy' and unnecessary features.

**Let's explain** what I mean by 'anarchy':
Some github users made PRs without even posting a new github issue to describe the idea or the bug before push their code,
surprisingly 100% of the changes to these PRs were for things that already implemented by
the framework but they had no clue because they didn't care or didn't have time to view the code closer, they just wanted to make an one-line PR and disappear.

We don't have any guarantee that an author of any PR will be here to answer to users or to fix a bug or
to make changes on future iris changes(and as ultimately this proved most of them they didn't care about your questions, your bug reports and you). **I'm responsible to individual developers and companies who using Iris to their projects.**
As you already noticed I'm online almost all the day to answer to your questions (almost instantly), fixing bugs and upgrading the code.
**This is why this Framework is not like others, it has the abiliy to be always synced with the latest trends and features happens around the world.**


Yes, I did disappointed by a small group of the community, I was waiting for more activity, I was imaging big work all together and the open-source idea.
After the results I came up, I had to pause this 'idea' on my mind for a very long time.
This is why I never ask you for a PR here, in the main repository, your contribution can be 'only' by
reporting bugs and feature requests, **these are not a small part, things like these made this framework so ideal.**

**The main repository's flow is: community recommends -> I code. I am not special, just a regular guy who really loves to code and happens to have all the world's time to code for Iris. No, I'm not a rich guy, I had some money from my previous job but over time as you can imagine, they are spending on my body's requirements, hopefuly we have nice guys and women who cares about these things and making donations that helping me to survive, as I left from my job months ago in order to start coding for Iris explicitly.**.



From the beggining, the project, gained incredible popularity in short-time,
the first month we broke all the rules, we were first on global-github-languages trending list.
**I always say 'we' because you're helping a lot, more than you can even imagine, with your bug reports and feature requests.**
So don't try to fool our selves, Iris has unique features and it's really one of the fastest web frameworks in globe, but these alone are nothing.


So why people loves and trust this framework for a long time of period? Because
 **they know where to find the guy who coded this and can ask anything, they get an answer instantly, they know where to stand if something goes bad to their app.**


BUT I'm choosing to give a second chance to people who want to contribution by code. If this time, the people who want to contribute by code do their jobs and mantain their responsibility to iris' users, there are good chances on the future that I will choose some of them, based on the code quality that will be pushed and their activity, in order to ask them for collaboration on the main iris repo too.

So the **[iris-contrib](https://github.com/iris-contrib) organisation and all its repositories will stay open for PRs.** Hopefully future-authors will be more responsible after this long text I wrote here, let's see how things will go on. **Only one term to future authors**: from now and on I want you to be responsible and answer to the future users' issues that are relative to your code. PR's authors must provide adequate support.
**Users is the most important part, we, as software authors, have to respect them. I don't accept any form of contempt to them(users) by anyone.**
